This bash shell script performs a static security scan by launching the OWASP dependency-check
and filtering the result to list the CVEs that it found. No other information is displayed - just
a unique list of CVEs. The depedency-check can be verbose and repetitive - hence the need for a 
script that prunes the content.

Prerequisites
=============
1) A recent version of Java 11 or higher installed with the java executable in the PATH and the
   JAVA_HOME environment variable defined. (dependency-check is Java-based)
2) dependency-check.sh installed and in the PATH. It can installed from here:
    https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/.
3) A directory with files to be scanned.

Usage
=====
